5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?
"""


"""
Answer...
There's only one global Python scope per program execution. This scope remains in existence
until the program terminates and all its names are forgotten.

Local scope or python scope are the scope which are  blue print of a function or lambda function.
Every time we call a function a new local scope is created.
