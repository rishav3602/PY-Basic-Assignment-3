4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?
"""


"""
Answer...

Function is basically a method that we code in a statement to perform a similar task with 
multiple datasets while function call is like calling an already defined function when we 
need them.

eg- 
def mul (a,b) ----- this is a function
    return a*b

print(mul(2,3)) ----- It is called as function call
